Hello,

You are to take over an ongoing Python project. The project's version-controlled files are provided from its GitHub repository. However, critical historical and procedural context is stored in files that are not tracked by Git. These necessary files have been uploaded for you alongside this prompt.

Your first step is to verify that you have received all the files listed in the "Required Files" section below.

Your second step is to follow the standard takeover procedure documented in the repository here:
`python_workspace/documentation/llm_takeover_procedures.md`
