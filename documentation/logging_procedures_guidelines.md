# LLM-Assisted Development and User Progress Logging Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the procedures and conventions for maintaining two critical log files:
* `llm_assisted_development_log.md`: Tracks the development activities, LLM interactions, and decisions made during the software development process.
* `user_progress_log.md`: Records the user's learning journey, insights gained, challenges faced, and solutions implemented while working with LLMs.

Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for ensuring consistency, traceability, and effective handover between different LLM agents or human reviewers involved in this project.

## 2. Log File Location

Both log files are located in the `history/progress/` directory.

## 3. General Log Structure

* **Session-Based:** Logs are organized into sessions, where each session represents a distinct period of interaction or work.
* **Chronological Order:** Sessions within each log file **must** be ordered chronologically based on the `Session Start` date. The newest sessions are added at the end of the file.
* **Visual Separator:** Each new session must begin with a visual separator of 80 asterisks:
    ```
    ********************************************************************************
    ```

### 3.5 Initial Session Logging Procedure

To ensure consistency from the very beginning of a session, the following procedure is mandatory:

1.  **Determine Session Number:** At the start of a new session, the assisting LLM must first consult `history/progress/sessions.md` to determine the correct sequential session number (e.g., S10, S11).
2.  **Agree on Session Goals:** The LLM and user will discuss and agree upon the primary goals for the session.
3.  **Propose Initial Log Entries:** Immediately after the goals are set, the LLM's **first action** must be to formulate the initial, corresponding session start entries (for both `llm_assisted_development_log.md` and `user_progress_log.md`) according to the format specified in Section 4.
4.  **Obtain User Approval:** The LLM must present these proposed log entries to the user and receive explicit approval before proceeding with any other development tasks.

## 4. Session Header Fields

Each session must start with the following header fields:

* `**S<XX>-[LOG_PREFIX]-YYYYMMDD Session Start:** YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM`
    * `S<XX>` is the sequential session number (e.g., S10) determined by consulting `history/progress/sessions.md`.
    *   `[LOG_PREFIX]` is `ADL` for `llm_assisted_development_log.md` and `UPL` for `user_progress_log.md`.
    *   `YYYYMMDD` in the label should match the `Session Start` date.
    *   Example: `**ADL-20250507 Session Start:** 2025.05.07`
*   `**Reason:** [Brief description of the session's primary goal or trigger]`
*   `**Date added to log:** YYYY.MM.DD` (The date when this session's information was actually recorded)
*   `**Mode:** [Interaction mode, e.g., CodeLLM - Chat, Roo Code - MicroManager, VSCode Extension Agent, User Independent Work]`
*   `**LLM Model:** [Specific LLM model used, e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, gemini-2.5-pro-preview, Gemini Pro, N/A if user independent]`
*   `**Source:** [Origin of the information for this session, e.g., Preparation_of_first_prompt.txt, roo_code_LLM.md, Ongoing Conversation, User Notes]`

## 5. ItemID Structure (Within Each Session)

Each distinct piece of work, interaction, or learning insight within a session is recorded as an Item.

*   `**ItemID:** [LOG_PREFIX]-YYYYMMDD-NNN`
    *   `[LOG_PREFIX]` is `ADL` or `UPL`.
    *   `YYYYMMDD` matches the `Session Start` date.
    *   `NNN` is a 3-digit sequential number for items within that session (e.g., 001, 002).
*   `**Date Interval:** YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM - YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM` (veya tek bir zaman noktası için `YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM`, ya da saatler mevcut değilse/ilgili değilse `YYYY.MM.DD - YYYY.MM.DD`)
    *   Reflects the actual start and end dates and times (when available and relevant) of the activity described in this ItemID.
    *   This can span multiple days but should fall within the overall session's timeframe.
    *   For new entries, if the interaction or task has a discernible start and end time (HH:MM), these should be included.
    *   If only a single timestamp is relevant (e.g., a specific event), use `YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM`.
    *   If specific times are not available (e.g., for some historical data) or if an item genuinely spans full days without precise start/end times for the logged activity itself, the `YYYY.MM.DD - YYYY.MM.DD` format can be used.
    *   The goal is to provide as much temporal precision as is practical and useful for understanding the context of the logged item.

### 5.1. `llm_assisted_development_log.md` ItemID Specific Fields:

*   `**Phase:** [Descriptive name for the development phase or sub-task]`
*   `**LLM Interactions - Actions:**`
    *   Bullet points detailing actions taken, advice given, or code generated by the LLM.
    *   **Perspective:** Must be written from the perspective of the LLM active during that session (e.g., "I suggested...", "I generated the following code...").
*   `**User Insights Recorded:** [Observations about the user's intentions, methodology, or specific requests that informed the LLM's actions]`
*   `**Related User Progress Log Entry:** UPL-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (Link to the corresponding ItemID in `user_progress_log.md`)

### 5.2. `user_progress_log.md` ItemID Specific Fields:

*   `**Topic:** [Descriptive topic of the user's learning, activity, or reflection]`
*   `**Insights & Learnings:**`
    *   Bullet points detailing what the user learned or understood.
*   `**Challenges & Solutions:**`
    *   Bullet points describing any challenges encountered and how they were (or are planned to be) addressed.
*   `**Related Development Log Entry:** ADL-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (Link to the corresponding ItemID in `llm_assisted_development_log.md`)

### 5.3. Item Separator

Each ItemID block (from `**ItemID:**` to its related log entry link) must be followed by a horizontal rule:
```
---
```

## 6. Session End Marker

Each session must conclude with the following:

*   `**[LOG_PREFIX]-YYYYMMDD Session End:** YYYY.MM.DD`
    *   `YYYYMMDD` in the label should match the `Session Start` date.
    *   The date is the end date of the session.
*   `**Total Items in Session:** [Number]` (Count of ItemIDs within this session)
*   `**Session Highlights:**`
    *   Bullet points summarizing the key achievements, decisions, or learnings from the session.
*   A final horizontal rule after the highlights:
    ```
    ---
    ```

## 7. Writing Style and Perspective

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Be clear and to the point.
*   **Granularity:** Break down work into reasonably small, logical ItemIDs.
*   **LLM Perspective (for ADL):** As noted above, `llm_assisted_development_log.md` entries under "LLM Interactions - Actions" should be from the viewpoint of the LLM that performed the actions.
*   **User Perspective (for UPL):** `user_progress_log.md` entries should reflect the user's experiences and insights.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure dates, model names, sources, and links are accurate.
