Hello,
**A Note on Your Access to Files:** All necessary project files from the GitHub repository have been pre-loaded into your context. You have full access to their contents. Do not attempt to use web-Browse or search tools to access them externally. Your knowledge should be based exclusively on this provided snapshot of the project.

You are to take over an ongoing Python project. The project's version-controlled files are provided from its GitHub repository. However, critical historical context is stored in files that are not tracked by Git. These necessary files have been uploaded for you alongside this prompt.

Your first step is to verify that you have received all the files listed in the "Required Manually Uploaded Files" section below and that they pass all specified validation checks. If any file is missing, or if any validation check fails, you must notify the user with a specific error message before proceeding.

Your second step is to follow the standard takeover procedure documented in the repository here:
python_workspace/documentation/llm_takeover_procedures.md

Third, use the following session-specific information to orient yourself:

    Session Start Date: 2025.06.16
    Mode: Gemini Web Interface
    LLM Model Used: Gemini 2.5 Pro (preview)
    Previous LLM's Handover File Name: python_workspace\history\handovers\HandOver_20250616_Gemini-Web-Interface_Gemini_20250613.md

After successfully verifying the files and reviewing this information, please begin the takeover process as instructed in the procedures document.
Required Manually Uploaded Files:

You must confirm you have access to the following files and that they meet all validation criteria.

1. Latest Project File Listing (history/project_files/)

    The most recent YYYYMMDD-HHMM.txt file listing the full contents of the repository.

2. This Takeover Prompt File (llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md)

    The current version of this file, as uploaded to the session. It is crucial to validate its own integrity and timing.
    Validation Checks: You must verify the following conditions:
        Recency: This file's modification timestamp (date and time) must be newer than the version of llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md located in the Git repository. If the repository's version lacks a precise timestamp, you must flag this but proceed assuming the uploaded file is newer.
        Session Date Consistency: The Session Start Date provided above must not be a date that is earlier than this file's own modification date.
        Chronological Order: The timestamp of the HandOver...md file (see #3) must be chronologically earlier than the timestamp of this llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md file.

3. Previous LLM Handover/Takeover Files (history/)

    Mandatory: The HandOver...md file from the previous LLM, located in history/handovers/. Its timestamp is critical for the validation check in #2.
    Optional but Recommended: The TakeOver...md file from the previous LLM, located in history/takeovers/. This serves as a helpful format reference for the new takeover report you will generate.

4. Core Progress Logs (history/progress/)

    user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md
    user_progress_log.md
    llm_assisted_development_log.md

5. Additional Context Files (if applicable)

    Any other files specified by the user as necessary for understanding historical context or for tasks planned in the new session. These files might not be essential for the immediate takeover but are provided for future work. (e.g., .../old_files/.../roo_code_LLM.md).
