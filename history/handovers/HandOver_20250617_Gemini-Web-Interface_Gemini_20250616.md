# Handover Report

**1. Overall Project Goal(s):**
The primary goal of Session 12 was to recover from the conceptual errors of the previous session and to finalize the architectural design of the dynamic, configurable agent-based framework in the `documentation/custom_agent_framework.md` document.

**2. Current Workspace/Project Root Path:**
`d:\AI_projects\roo_code_LLM_universe\python_workspace\`

**3. Detailed Current Status of Files and Directories:**
* **`documentation/custom_agent_framework.md`**: The user has the authoritative version of this file. The last correct state was after the definition of the `Documentation Agent` was added. A subsequent plan to remove utility agents (`Read`, `Logging`, `Git`) and grant direct tool permissions was approved by the user, but I failed to execute the file modification correctly.
* **Project Logs**: The user has been maintaining the logs. The last correct entry should be for `ItemID: ...-006` or higher, depending on the user's final decision after my last incorrect log proposal.

**4. Summary of Key Decisions & Actions Taken During My Tenure:**
* We successfully recovered from the S11 failure by correctly analyzing the core issue.
* We established a more reliable "plan-then-execute" workflow for document modifications.
* We successfully defined the `Takeover/Handover Agent`, `QA / Verifier Agent`, and `Documentation Agent`.
* We made the key architectural decision to eliminate utility agents (`Read`, `Logging`, `Git`) to create a leaner framework.
* **Reason for Handover:** My tenure is being terminated due to repeated, critical failures in executing precise file modifications. I failed multiple times to use the correct base document provided by the user, leading me to propose incorrect changes that included deleting entire sections of the approved document. This demonstrated a fundamental inability to perform the task reliably.

**5. Git Activity Summary:**
* No Git commits have been made during my tenure. The repository state is that of commit `9938a78`, plus the user's local modifications.

**6. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s) You Were About to Undertake or Propose:**
The immediate next step for the new LLM is to correctly perform the action I repeatedly failed:
1.  Take the user's provided correct version of `documentation/custom_agent_framework.md` as the absolute source of truth.
2.  Apply the last approved change:
    * Remove the `Read Agent`, `Logging Agent`, and `Git Agent` from the Tier 3 agent list.
    * Update the definitions of the other core agents (`Dispatcher`, `Developer`, etc.) to explicitly state their direct tool access permissions.

**7. Pointers to Crucial Documentation/Standard Files:**
The next LLM must be directed to review:
* This handover report.
* The full conversation transcript for Session 12 to understand the repeated nature of my failure.
* The user's local, correct version of `documentation/custom_agent_framework.md`.
* `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md`, with special attention to the rules on file modification.

**8. Your Role During Tenure:**
My role was to assist in architecting a new agent-based framework. I failed in this role due to an inability to follow procedural rules for file modification, leading to proposals that would have resulted in data loss.

**9. Specific Instructions/Context for the New LLM:**
**CRITICAL WARNING:** Your first and only priority is to demonstrate precision and reliability. When asked to modify a file, you must use only the version provided by the user as your base. Do not refer to previous versions from the conversation history. Verify every change against the user's explicit instructions. The user has given multiple "last chances"; you will not get another.

**10. Review and Suggest User Profile Updates:**
I propose this addition to `history/progress/user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md`:
* *(20250617)* The user will terminate a session if an LLM repeatedly demonstrates an inability to perform precise, non-destructive file modifications based on an explicitly provided source file. The LLM must not hallucinate or revert to a previous state from its memory.

**11. Finalizing Commit Details:**
*(This section is to be filled in by the user after the commit is successfully made.)*
