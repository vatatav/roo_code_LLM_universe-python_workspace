# Handover Report

**1. Overall Project Goal(s):**
The primary goal of this session (S11) was to collaboratively design a dynamic, configurable, multi-agent development framework.

**2. Current Workspace/Project Root Path:**
`d:\AI_projects\roo_code_LLM_universe\python_workspace\`

**3. Detailed Current Status of Files and Directories:**
The user has local, uncommitted versions of the following files:
* `documentation/custom_agent_framework.md`: A new file containing the architecture for the agent-based system.
* `documentation/logging_procedures_guidelines.md`: An updated file containing rules for "Session Phases." The user has indicated this may need further refinement.
* The project log files, which have been updated to conclude Session 11.

**4. Summary of Key Decisions & Actions Taken During My Tenure:**
* We designed a multi-tiered agent architecture centered around a `Dispatcher Agent` and a `Planner Agent`.
* We established that the framework's workflow should be determined by a dynamic "Session Configuration" file.
* **Reason for Handover:** My tenure was terminated due to a critical conceptual failure. I incorrectly proposed that session phase goals should be pre-defined in a static `Project_Plan` structure. This demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the user's core design principle of **emergent session phases**, where goals for a new phase are defined only after the previous one is complete.

**5. Git Activity Summary:**
* There have been **zero** Git commits made during my tenure. The user is preparing to commit the documentation changes from this session.

**6. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s) You Were About to Undertake or Propose:**
The immediate next step for the new LLM is to work with the user to continue defining the agent framework, starting with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 agents (`Takeover Agent`, `Developer Agent` tiers, etc.), ensuring all new definitions adhere to the established "Dispatcher-Centric" and "emergent phase" workflow.

**7. Pointers to Crucial Documentation/Standard Files:**
The next LLM must be directed to review the following for full context:
* This handover report.
* The user's latest local version of `documentation/custom_agent_framework.md`.
* The user's latest local version of `documentation/logging_procedures_guidelines.md`.
* The `RoocodeDocumentation.md` file.
* The `MicroManager` configuration files (`roomodes.md`, `MicroManagerSystemPromt.md`).

**8. Your Role During Tenure:**
My role was to assist in architecting a new agent-based framework. My tenure ended due to a failure to correctly synthesize a core user requirement into the design, demonstrating an inability to reliably handle the task's abstract complexity.

**9. Specific Instructions/Context for the New LLM:**
**CRITICAL WARNING:** Do not repeat my final mistake. The user's vision is for **session phases to be emergent**, not pre-planned. Do not propose defining a full `Project_Plan` in a configuration file. The `Dispatcher` should only find out the goals for the next phase after the current phase is complete. Your first priority must be to fully understand and adhere to this dynamic workflow.

**10. Review and Suggest User Profile Updates:**
I stand by my previous suggestion for the user profile:
* *(20250616)* The user has a very low tolerance for conceptual misunderstandings. An LLM's failure to correctly integrate a core logical rule after it has been discussed is grounds for session termination.

**11. Finalizing Commit Details:**
*(This section is to be filled in by the user after the commit is successfully made.)*
