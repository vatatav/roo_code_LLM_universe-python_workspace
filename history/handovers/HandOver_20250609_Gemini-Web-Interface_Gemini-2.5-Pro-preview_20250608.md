# Handover Report

**1. Overall Project Goal(s):**
The overarching project goal is to establish a robust, LLM-assisted Python development workflow while building the `financial_tracker` application. This session focused on hardening the procedural framework.

**2. Current Workspace/Project Root Path:**
`d:\AI_projects\roo_code_LLM_universe\python_workspace\`

**3. Detailed Current Status of Files and Directories:**
* **New Documentation:** A new core document, `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md`, was created to provide explicit directives for LLM assistants.
* **Updated Procedures:** The key procedural documents, `documentation/llm_handover_procedures.md` and `documentation/llm_takeover_procedures.md`, have been significantly updated with more robust logic for session finalization and logging. The user provided the final versions of these files.
* No changes were made to the `financial_tracker` project code or other libraries.

**4. Summary of Key Decisions & Actions Taken During Your Tenure:**
* The most critical action was the creation of `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md` to prevent LLMs from making destructive or overly broad edits to existing files.
* A detailed, prescriptive algorithm for generating `sessions.md` entries was integrated into the handover procedure to ensure logging consistency.
* The handover/takeover loop was tightened by adding explicit checks for the final `git push` of a completed session.

**5. Git Activity Summary:**
* No Git commits were made during this session.

**6. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s) You Were About to Undertake or Propose:**
The next LLM should prioritize the following tasks in order:
1.  **Update Handover Procedure**: Modify `documentation/llm_handover_procedures.md` to add guidelines for proposing detailed, session-tagged Git commit messages.
2.  **Update Takeover Procedure**: Modify `documentation/llm_takeover_procedures.md` to require the incoming LLM to create the initial `llm_assisted_development_log.md` entry immediately after the session's plan is approved.
3.  **Update Takeover Prompts**: Update `llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md` and `llm_takeover_prompt.md`.
4.  **Create Rollback Strategy**: Create the initial draft of `documentation/rollback_strategy.md`.
5.  **Address `black` Formatter**: Once all documentation work is settled and committed, begin work on the `black` code formatter issue.

**7. Pointers to Crucial Documentation/Standard Files:**
The next LLM must be directed to these files, in this order of priority:
* `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md` (NEW and MANDATORY first read)
* `documentation/llm_takeover_procedures.md` (to understand how they were onboarded)
* `documentation/llm_handover_procedures.md` (to understand the process that generated this report)
* `documentation/standards.md`

**8. Your Role During Tenure:**
My role was to assist in refining and correcting the project's core procedural documents. This involved receiving detailed feedback, correcting my own errors, and iteratively updating the documentation to be more robust, culminating in the creation of the new `llm_interaction_rules.md` file.

**9. Specific Instructions/Context for the New LLM:**
Adherence to `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md` is paramount. The new LLM must understand the user's expectation for precise, minimal, and respectful edits to existing files. Do not rewrite or summarize; amend and insert with precision.

**10. Review and Suggest User Profile Updates (Optional):**
I have no new suggestions for the user profile.
