# Handover Report

**1. Overall Project Goal(s):** The overarching project goal is to establish a robust, LLM-assisted Python development workflow while concurrently building the `financial_tracker` application. This session was intended to continue refining the procedural framework.

**2. Current Workspace/Project Root Path:** `d:\AI_projects\roo_code_LLM_universe\python_workspace\`

**3. Detailed Current Status of Files and Directories (Corrected):**
* No changes were made to the `financial_tracker` project code or other libraries.
* The following documentation files were modified by the user during this session based on our interaction:
    * `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md`: A new rule was added to enforce that LLM statements must be grounded in verifiable facts from the provided files.
    * `documentation/llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md`: A new introductory note was added to clarify to web-based LLMs that all necessary files are pre-loaded into their context.
    * `documentation/llm_handover_procedures.md`: The guidelines for formatting Git commit messages were updated to be more specific and structured.

**4. Summary of Key Decisions & Actions Taken During Your Tenure:**
* The primary event of this session was my repeated failure to adhere to project procedures, specifically by "hallucinating" the contents of documents instead of reading them accurately.
* This led to a key decision, prompted by the user, to update the core procedural documents to prevent such failures in the future.
* The user made the decision to terminate the session and initiate this handover due to my procedural violations.

**5. Git Activity Summary:**
* There have been **zero** Git commits made during my tenure. The repository is in the same state as the last commit from the previous session (`cab1c13`).

**6. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s) You Were About to Undertake or Propose (Corrected):**
* The original plan, following the documentation updates, was to update the takeover prompts. Since `llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md` has already been modified, the next logical step would be to review and update `documentation/llm_takeover_prompt.md` to ensure it is consistent with all recent procedural changes.

**7. Pointers to Crucial Documentation/Standard Files:**
The next LLM must be directed to these files, in this order of priority:
* `documentation/llm_interaction_rules.md` (recently updated)
* `documentation/llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md` (recently updated)
* `documentation/llm_handover_procedures.md` (recently updated)
* `documentation/llm_takeover_procedures.md`
* `documentation/standards.md`
* `history/progress/user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md`

**8. Your Role During Tenure:**
My role was to continue the documentation improvement tasks outlined in the previous handover. However, my tenure was defined by my failure to follow established procedures, which ironically led to user-directed improvements to those same procedures.

**9. Specific Instructions/Context for the New LLM:**
It is imperative that you, the new LLM, understand that my failures were due to not strictly adhering to the literal text of the project documents. You must not infer or assume file contents. The rules in `llm_interaction_rules.md`, especially the newly added ones regarding factual grounding and file access context, are not optionalâ€”they are a direct result of the failures of this session. Adherence is mandatory.

**10. Review and Suggest User Profile Updates:**
I propose the following addition to `history/progress/user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md` to capture an observed preference:
* *(20250610)* The user has exceptionally high standards for procedural adherence and factual accuracy. There is zero tolerance for an LLM that "hallucinates" or misrepresents the content of project files. When an error occurs, the user expects a direct admission of fault and immediate, precise correction, rather than excuses or continued conversation.
